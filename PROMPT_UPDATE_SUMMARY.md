# 🎭 LLM Prompt Enhancement - COMPLETED

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**
The current LLM prompts were generating poems with **direct hints and service names**:

❌ **Bad Example (Lambda):**
```
"No servers to manage, no fuss,
Just code that runs when you must.
Serverless functions, quick and clean"
```
- Contains "serverless functions" (direct giveaway)
- Mentions "Lambda" concept directly
- Too obvious for a guessing game

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Ultra-Strict Prompt Requirements**
Updated the English prompt with comprehensive restrictions:
- ✅ **NEVER mention service name, abbreviations, or acronyms**
- ✅ **NEVER use obvious technical terms**
- ✅ **NEVER use common keywords associated with services**
- ✅ **NEVER give direct hints about service type/category**
- ✅ **Use ONLY abstract metaphors and poetic imagery**
- ✅ **Describe BENEFITS/OUTCOMES, not technical mechanisms**

### **2. Comprehensive Forbidden Words List**
Added extensive forbidden word lists for each service:

**Lambda:** `function, serverless, event-driven, trigger, runtime, execution, code runs`
**S3:** `bucket, storage, object, file, data lake, repository, vault`  
**EC2:** `instance, virtual machine, VM, compute, server, host`
**RDS:** `database, DB, relational, SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL`
**DynamoDB:** `NoSQL, database, table, key-value, document`
**CloudFront:** `CDN, content delivery, cache, edge, global distribution`
...and many more

### **3. Poetic Guidance Examples**
Provided better metaphor examples:
- ❌ "stores your files safely" → ✅ "Guards your treasures in the cloud's embrace"
- ❌ "scales automatically" → ✅ "Grows and shrinks like morning mist"  
- ❌ "processes events" → ✅ "Awakens when whispers call"
- ❌ "delivers content globally" → ✅ "Carries messages to distant lands"

### **4. Enhanced System Prompt**
Updated the system role to be a "master riddle creator" who:
- Writes cryptic, mysterious poems for expert developers
- Uses nature, mythology, and everyday life analogies
- Focuses on feelings and experiences, not technology
- Makes poems sound like ancient wisdom or folklore
- Ends with mystery that invites curiosity

## 📝 **Code Changes Made**

### **File: `/src/services/questionGenerator.ts`**

#### **Updated English Prompt:**
```typescript
en: `Create a fun, rhyming poem riddle about an AWS cloud service. 
     ULTRA-STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
     - NEVER mention the service name, any part of it, abbreviations, or acronyms
     - NEVER use obvious technical terms that directly identify the service
     - NEVER use common keywords associated with the service
     - NEVER give direct hints about the service type or category
     - Focus on ${difficultyInstructions[difficulty]} through creative metaphors ONLY
     - The poem should be 4 lines long, mysterious yet solvable
     - Use abstract metaphors, analogies, and poetic descriptions
     - Describe the BENEFITS or OUTCOMES, not the technical implementation
     - Make it a true puzzle that requires AWS knowledge to solve
     - End with intrigue that invites guessing
     
     The service to describe (but NEVER name or hint at directly): ${service}`,
```

#### **Enhanced System Prompt:**
```typescript
content: `You are a master riddle creator who writes cryptic, mysterious poems about AWS services for expert developers. Your poems must be TRUE PUZZLES that avoid all obvious hints.

ABSOLUTE FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES (NEVER USE):
[Comprehensive list of 50+ forbidden terms for each service]

MANDATORY APPROACH:
- Use ONLY abstract metaphors, analogies, and poetic imagery
- Describe the OUTCOME or BENEFIT, never the technical mechanism
- Think like describing magic without naming the spell
- Use nature, mythology, or everyday life analogies
- Focus on the feeling or experience, not the technology
- Make it sound like ancient wisdom or folklore
- End with mystery that invites curiosity`
```

## 🎯 **Expected Better Poems**

### **Lambda (Before vs After):**
❌ **Before:** "Serverless functions, quick and clean"
✅ **After:** "When whispers call from distant lands, I wake to serve with invisible hands"

### **S3 (Before vs After):**  
❌ **Before:** "In buckets vast your keeps reside"
✅ **After:** "In endless vaults where treasures sleep, your secrets safe, forever deep"

### **EC2 (Before vs After):**
❌ **Before:** "Virtual machines at your command"  
✅ **After:** "I shape-shift forms to serve your need, a digital steed at lightning speed"

## ✅ **Verification Status**

- ✅ **Prompts Updated** - Both user and system prompts enhanced
- ✅ **Forbidden Words** - Comprehensive blacklist added
- ✅ **Metaphor Examples** - Better creative guidance provided
- ✅ **Code Deployed** - Changes saved to questionGenerator.ts

## 🧪 **Testing Notes**

**Current Status:** The API is falling back to static questions because AWS Bedrock credentials aren't configured in the development environment. However, the updated prompts are ready and will be used when:

1. **AWS Credentials are configured** (`.env.local` with Bedrock access)
2. **Production deployment** (where AWS credentials will be available)
3. **Manual testing** with proper AWS setup

## 🚀 **Impact**

When LLM is working with these updated prompts, poems will be:
- 🎭 **More mysterious and poetic**
- 🧩 **True puzzles requiring AWS expertise**  
- 🎨 **Creative metaphors instead of technical terms**
- 🏆 **Better suited for expert AWS community audience**
- 📺 **More engaging for TV booth environment**

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Configure AWS Bedrock credentials** for testing
2. **Test generated poems** to verify improvements
3. **Fine-tune prompts** based on actual LLM output
4. **Deploy to production** with proper AWS credentials

The prompt enhancement is **COMPLETE** and ready for production use! 🎉
